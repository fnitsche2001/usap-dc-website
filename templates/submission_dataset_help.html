        require that metadata files, full data sets, and derived data products, must be deposited in a long-lived and publicly 
        accessible archive.
    </p>

    <p>
        USAP-DC accepts data submissions of research data resulting from NSF-funded Antarctic projects and provides repository 
        services for these data including data publication in the DOI<span>&#174;</span> system and long-term archiving. 
        Before submitting to USAP-DC we encourage you to consider whether there is an appropriate disciplinary repositor for 
        your data types; best practice is to use disciplinary data repositories if available. If you submit your data elsewhere 
        you will be asked to register the dataset links or DOI’s from this repository in your USAP-DC Project Catalog entry. 
    </p>

    <p>
        To submit data to USAP-DC, please use our <a target="_blank" href="{{url_for('dataset')}}">“Deposit Dataset”</a> webform.   
    </p>

    <p>
        After logging in, the submitter is asked to provide key information (metadata) about the dataset which will support 
        the curation and long-term archiving of the data, search and discovery by others, as well as the context and background 
        information necessary for future researchers to make use of your data. 
    </p>

    <p>
        You can upload one or many data files as part of your submission. The data should be submitted using a common, open 
        format to maximize later reuse, and descriptive filenames. 
        See the <a target="_blank" href="{{url_for('faq', _anchor='qd6')}}">FAQ for information on data formats</a>.
        If you have a very large dataset, e.g. many Giga or TeraBytes in size, please 
        <a target="_blank" href="{{url_for('contact')}}">contact us</a> directly to arrange for separate data transfer.
    </p>

    <p>
        Data submissions will be registered and a data DOI provided for each dataset. This DOI can be used to reference the 
        dataset in publications.
    </p>
    <p>
        A dataset title and abstract are required with each data submission and are used to help others find data of interest 
        in searches and browsers. A good dataset title is short but with enough specific details to help others understand 
        and uniquely identify the nature of the dataset such as data type, location, temporal range, and field program. 
        The dataset title will be used for the DOI record. 
    </p>

    <p>
        The dataset will be linked to an NSF award, if one exists. We will also use the award number to link the dataset to 
        the USAP-DC Project catalog existing project page for the award.
    </p>

    <p>
        If there are relevant publications (e.g. that describe details of the dataset) information about them should be 
        included. If available, please provide the publication DOI, so we can link directly to the publication. 
    </p>

    <p>
        The submission form includes free-text fields for providing details regarding instruments, acquisition and 
        processing procedures that will allow future users to understand and use the data. In preparing your descriptions, 
        please consider what detailed information you like to see, if you would be reusing the data.
    </p>

    <p>
        Submitted datasets will be reviewed by USAP-DC curators to check for data integrity and that the necessary metadata 
        information is submitted.
    </p>

    <p>
        Using the “edit” function, users associated with the dataset will be able to update dataset information, including 
        adding a publication or publication DOI linked to the dataset. If a new version of the actual dataset is being 
        submitted, it will be stored as a new dataset with a link to the previous version.
