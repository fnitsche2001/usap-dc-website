	<h2>Antarctic Seismic Data Library System (SDLS)</h2>

	<h3>About SDLS</h3>
	The <a target="_blank" href="https://sdls.ogs.trieste.it/">Antarctic Seismic Data Library System</a> (SDLS) works under the auspices of Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.scar.org/">SCAR</a>) and the Antarctic Treaty (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.ats.aq/e/ats.htm">ATCM XVI-12</a>) to provide open access to all multichannel seismic-reflection data collected south of 60Â° S to study the structure of the earth's crust of Antarctica. This page provides links to answers for many common questions about the SDLS, and how the library system can be used by all researchers.

	The SDLS is under the mandates of the Antarctic Treaty System, and as such, all institutions that collect MCS data in Antarctica must submit their MCS data to the SDLS. The formal guidelines that govern the SDLS are outlined in general in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ats.aq/e/ats.htm">Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting Resolution XVI-12</a>, and in particular in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.scar.org/publications/reports/9/">SCAR Report No 9</a>.

	<h3>Lamont SDLS branch</h3>
	The SCAR Seismic Data Library System (SDLS) has branches worldwide. The US branches are hosted by USGS (Menlo Park, CA) and Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (Palisades, NY).

	<h3>Services at the Lamont SDLS branch</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Local DVD copies of multi-channel seismic data in the SDLS system for scientist to review</li>

		<li>Provide assistance with submissions of seismic data to the SDLS</li>

		<li>Integrate SDLS publicly available seismic data into <a target="_blank" href="http://www.geomapapp.org/">GeoMapApp</a> for viewing and browsing
		(in GeoMapApp choose the Antarctic basemap. Then select Portals -> Digital seismic reflection profiles and select Antarctic SDLS
		or choose Data Layers -> Geophysics -> Antarctic Seismic reflection tracks for an overview of existing lines)</li>
