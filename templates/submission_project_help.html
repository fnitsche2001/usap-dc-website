    <br><br>

    <p>
        The USAP-DC project catalog is an inventory of projects (awards or collaborative research awards) funded by the 
        NSF US Antarctic Program with links to the different datasets generated by the projects. 
        These datasets can be hosted by different repositories including USAP-DC.
    </p>

    <p>
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf16055">NSF guidelines</a> 
        require that PIs who have received an award from the NSF US Antarctic Program register their project 
        with the USAP-DC Project Catalog using their award number and related award numbers for collaborative research projects. 
        New projects should be registered soon after NSF has made an award (awards made in or after 2020 need to include links 
        to their project page in their annual reports). The project page can be updated throughout the lifetime of the project. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Upon registration, a project page will be created within the USAP-DC Project Catalog which is the central catalog 
        of information about NSF funded projects of the USAP. The information for your project page is submitted using a 
        simple web form that asks for project information including co-Investigators, field programs, resulting datasets and publications 
        (<a target="_blank" href="{{url_for('project_landing_page',project_id='p0010018')}}">see example</a>). To make the process easier, 
        any information about the project available from the NSF award database will be automatically included, but PI’s can update this 
        information if necessary (for example, when the end date has changed). 
    </p>

    <p>
        The form will be pre-populated with the information from the main award that you select from the pull-down menu. 
        If this is a collaborative research award that includes multiple award numbers, e.g. to different institutions, 
        you can use the “Add additional award linked to project” option to add these additional awards.
        Likewise, you can add additional people using the “add another author” option. 
    </p>

    <p>
        If datasets, references or other information are not yet available, they can be added at a later time to the 
        project record using the “edit” button on your Project Catalog page (see below for details). 
    </p>
      
    <p>
        If you have submitted your project-related research data to USAP-DC, we will link your dataset to your project. If your 
        datasets are submitted to other repositories, please provide the dataset title and repository link to the dataset. 
    </p>

    <p>
        If your project/award is part of an overarching science project (e.g. ANDRILL, WAIS Divide Ice Core, Thwaites-ITGC), 
        please select the initiative from the drop-down menu for selecting a Special Science Program. This will enable users 
        to search and filter for projects that are part of these initiatives.
        If your overarching science project or initiative is not listed, please add this in the comment box at the end of the 
        webform and we will add it to the menu of options.
    </p>

    <p>
        Location and GCMD keywords are selected from pre-populated lists. The latter is based on the GCMD/AMD keyword vocabulary 
        and will be used to prepare your project entry for the Antarctic Master Directory.  
    </p>

    <p>
        After you submitted your project registration USAP-DC staff will check your submission before the actual page is published. 
        Usually, this takes 1-2 business days. The staff might contact you, if they have any questions regarding your submission. 
    </p>

    <p>
        After the initial project page has been created you can update your project page using the “Edit” button located in the top 
        right corner of the page. The edit button links to a pre-populated form with all the information previously entered for your 
        project, where edits and updates can be made. The submitted updates will be vetted by a USAP-DC data curator before they are 
        published on your project page.  
    </p>

    <p>
        Note that only users linked to the project by email address or ORCID can make edits. If a user tries to edit a project page 
        to which the user is not linked or for whom the authentication on file is insufficient, the user will be presented with an 
        option to request this access.
    </p>

    <p>
        Based on the project information, USAP-DC will create a metadata record (DIF) and submit it to the Antarctic Master Directory (AMD). 
        This will usually happen after the first datasets have been linked to the project page.
